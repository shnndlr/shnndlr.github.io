In this page, I will talk about the song meanings of the kpop girl group **'ITZY'**.

## Introducing ITZY!

ITZY is a girl group under JYP Entertainment. They made their debut with the single "It'z Different" on February 11, 2019. Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong, and Yuna are the group's five members. On January 31, 2019, a music video teaser was released, announcing the group's debut on February 11, 2019 with the single "It'z Different" and its title track "Dalla Dalla."

The intro does a great job of visually and verbally introducing the girls and what the group is all about. Â  If you don't speak Korean, the words in this hook will help you understand what the rest of the song is about. 'I love myself' demonstrates how the girls are uplifting and individual, pushing the concept of the new wave of modern girl groups that are focused on the concept of confidence.
