In this page, I will talk about the song meanings of the kpop girl group **'ITZY'**.

## Introducing ITZY!

ITZY is a girl group under JYP Entertainment. They made their debut with the single "It'z Different" on February 11, 2019. Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong, and Yuna are the group's five members. On January 31, 2019, a music video teaser was released, announcing the group's debut on February 11, 2019 with the single "It'z Different" and its title track "Dalla Dalla."

The intro does a great job of visually and verbally introducing the girls and what the group is all about. If you don't speak Korean, the words in this hook will help you understand what the rest of the song is about. 'I love myself' demonstrates how the girls are uplifting and independent, pushing the concept of the new wave of modern girl groups that are focused on the concept of confidence.

This has been defined as a "blazing and energizing summer song". In a showcase, Itzy characterized the song as an implication of the group's first song, "Dalla Dalla," share common meanings but having a much more joyful and uplifting vibe.

People expected it to be a girl crush concept, but it was more of a girl power concept.

The song explains their various personalities.
- How unique everyone is.
- People should prioritize themselves over others.
- Everyone has their own point of view.
- Allow people to do whatever they want as long as it does not harm anyone.
- No one should cover up themselves as someone else's ideal personality.
- No one should be troubled with the negative remarks of others.

### Not Shy

'Not Shy' is a captivating piece that captures ITZY's personalities. Morest specially, it demonstrates each member's musical abilities as well as how well they work together. The song's premise is about a girl who is in love with one guy and is not afraid to express her feelings. She has a strong personality and is not afraid to express herself. The music is cool, and the lyrics add a lot of sass to the whole thing. Throughout the piece, elements of pop and rap flow together splendidly.

### 마.피.아. In the morning

In the morning is based on the game ‘Mafia’ or ‘Werewolf’ where two or more people are chosen to slay civilians. The song is about love and romance, and how the girls hide their emotions particularly in Ryujin's second line, she tells, "Do I show You? No, not I." ITZY in ‘마.피.아. In the morning’ everyone tries their hardest to be the last one standing.

### Loco

Lyrically, the song portrays how the girls are caught between the feelings of becoming addicted to someone and despising them. They also accuse themselves of being insane as a result of their bizarre emotional roller coaster. While its line is being sung, the choreography portrays them losing their minds, holding onto their heads and having to turn their heads around. Some believe that turning your head in circles is a sign that someone is causing you to lose your mind or somebody is leading you insane.
